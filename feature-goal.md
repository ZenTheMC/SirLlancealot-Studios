About Me Page:
Contact Me should navigate to contact page
Styling to make the about me summary sit to the right of the img, and the contact me to sit right under the image

Contact Page:
Add FontAwesome Icons for the phone, email, and socials

See More Button:
Style the see more button better, so it's a black background and white text

Index.html:
Do we even need the modal and See More button and stuff for the logo img?
We're not using them, and we explicitly are preventing them from being included in the homePage image modals, so why should we keep it? Probably best to remove it if it doesn't break anything.
